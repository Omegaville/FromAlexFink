# Divvy
Dive is a 2048-like blending additive and multiplicative number theory,
invented by [Allen Knutson](https://www.google.com/+AllenKnutson) and others
and implemented first by [TheMoreYouKnow](https://github.com/themoreyouknow).

Divvy is a mod by Omegaville.  Trying to get this damn thing to work, won't let me commit changes!!!

If you're reading this, you probably already know what 2048 is, so forgive me for keeping this short.
